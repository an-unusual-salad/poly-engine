
Welcome to the aPLib documentation!
===================================

aPLib is a compression library based on the algorithm used in aPACK (my 16-bit
executable packer). aPLib is an easy-to-use alternative to many of the
heavy-weight compression libraries available.

The compression ratios achieved by aPLib combined with the speed and tiny
footprint of the decompressors (as low as 169 bytes!) makes it the ideal
choice for many products.
